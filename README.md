# Parking Lot Management System

The Parking Lot Management System was developed to illustrate the practical implementation of core data structures and algorithms. It utilizes linked lists for dynamic vehicle tracking, queues to manage the sequence of vehicle entry and exit, and search algorithms to efficiently locate parked vehicles. This project highlights the integration of theoretical concepts into a functional system for real-world parking management scenarios.
